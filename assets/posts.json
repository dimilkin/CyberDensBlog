For this purpose, both systems use intermediaries that have access only to the necessary information for a specific purpose, following strictly defined rules and mechanisms. In the case of DNA, such an intermediary is messenger RNA (mRNA), whose task is to copy a specific section of DNA and make it possible to read it through a process called transcription."

The result of this process is a copy of the requested information, which, however, is not yet ready for immediate use by the biological or computer system. This is followed by the process of translating the information - the so-called translation. In the biological system, this includes the creation of a protein molecule according to the instructions recorded in mRNA. In computer systems (with slight conventions), the process is similar and is called deserialization. The end result is a logically new object that the respective system can use. In the biological context, this is a specific protein with a characteristic structure and function, while in the software system, this is a specific data object that facilitates working with the data."

DNA itself is a complete set of information that cannot be easily added to or removed - or at least it is not recommended. The available data can be modified, but this happens slowly and with difficulty on random principles. On the other hand, databases are created to collect data. The recording of information is carried out through a complex mechanism to guarantee the integrity, homogeneity, and reliability of the data upon completion of the record. These principles are particularly critical for medical information."

Recent EU legislative acts — Directive 2011/24/EU, Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1765, and Regulation (EU) 2021/2282 — build the foundation of this transformation. They form a framework that strengthens patient rights, develops connected digital health systems, and harmonizes the assessment of health technologies. This text examines how these initiatives are shaping the future of healthcare in Europe and what they mean for health professionals and for the National Health Information System (NHIS) in Bulgaria."

Patients can travel for treatment abroad if it is covered by their national health system. Reimbursement of costs is at the same level as for treatment in their own country, but cannot exceed the actual cost of the service. In some cases — such as hospital stays or highly specialized treatment — prior authorization may be required.\nThe directive also defines the responsibilities of the country of origin and the country of treatment. The former is responsible for reimbursing costs and for follow-up care, while the latter must ensure safe and quality health services on equal terms for foreign patients. Beyond individual rights, the document encourages cooperation through European Reference Networks for rare diseases and through digital initiatives, which today are reflected in European health systems such as Bulgaria's NHIS."

The goal is to ensure that citizens' medical data can be securely exchanged between individual countries, thus facilitating access to health services throughout the EU.\nThe network's objective is to ensure the integration of electronic health records, to provide conditions for the development of telemedicine, mobile applications, artificial intelligence, and big data analysis in healthcare. Security and protection of personal data are fundamental principles, with strict cybersecurity standards being introduced. The network also proved its importance during the COVID-19 pandemic, when it supported the interoperability of national contact tracing applications.\nBy 2025, all 27 member states are actively participating in this network. For Bulgaria, through NHIS, this means integration into the European digital infrastructure and access to cross-border health data exchange through the National Contact Points for eHealth."

The goal is for new medicines, medical devices, and therapies to be evaluated in a scientifically sound and coordinated manner throughout the EU. Instead of each country conducting separate analyses, joint clinical assessments will be carried out, especially for new oncology drugs, therapies for rare diseases, and high-risk medical devices. This reduces duplication of effort and accelerates patient access to innovations.\nManufacturers will be able to receive scientific advice at the European level to design clinical trials that meet the needs of HTA bodies. Although pricing decisions remain a national competence, countries will work with a common scientific basis. For Bulgaria, this means that NHIS and related institutions will be able to use these assessments as part of the process of integrating new technologies into the health system."

Successful transformation requires solutions that are tailored to both patient needs and the specific characteristics of health systems. Exchange of good practices, investment in integrated infrastructure, and development of digital skills among medical professionals and citizens are necessary.\nIn Bulgaria, through NHIS, these processes are woven into national practice, allowing better access to data, higher quality services, and participation in European networks. NHIS should develop not only as an administrative system, but as a key tool for health data exchange and integration into the European digital health space.\nFor Bulgarian professionals, these legislative acts mean a future in which clinical practice, patient access, and the implementation of innovations will be better coordinated at the European level. Knowledge of these rules is key not only for compliance with requirements, but also for active participation in the transformation of healthcare through NHIS."
